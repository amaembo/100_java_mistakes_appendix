# Sample project to test static analysis plugins

This is a sample project that could be used to test static analysis plugins
available in this Git repository. It also contains an inspection profile 
with a structural search inspection that reports calls like `Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)`.
This sample is described in the appendix of the book
"[100 Java Mistakes and How to Avoid Them](https://www.manning.com/books/100-java-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them)" by
Tagir Valeev.
